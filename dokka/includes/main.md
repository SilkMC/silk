Silk [[sÉªlk]](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/media/english/us_pron_ogg/s/sil/silk_/silk__us_1.ogg)
is a Minecraft API for [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - targetting [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) and
[Paper](https://papermc.io/). <br>

### About

Silk is a bridge between [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) and common Kotlin language
features, libraries, [DSLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) and more.

The library offers you stable and simple APIs for common tasks in mod development.

### Setup with Gradle

Click on each module below to get started with it and to see how to use it in your build environment.

#### **IMPORTANT** Temporary setup requirement

**See [this gist](https://gist.github.com/jakobkmar/5068aa14e37b859c3246de91cac74347) to learn how to use Silk 1.9.1
and above.** This is only temporary, due to Silk already making use of context receivers.

### Provide it at runtime

If you use Silk, it must be available at runtime.

You can declare a dependency on the Silk releases on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/silk/versions)
or [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/silk-kt/files). <br> For users manually downloading your mod
you should advise them to download Silk alongside your mod.
